# Weather
A weather app ☁️ that uses api to give you temperature 🌡️ and air quality of any given city. Also working on integrating more features such as time vs temperature graph 📈 and much more... 

Just a project for hands-on experience and learning. Feel free to raise issues (if any)and suggestions are welcomed!🙏
